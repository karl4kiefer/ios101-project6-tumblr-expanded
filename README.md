## Notes

- [ ] I found this project to be fun and informative. Working with UI interests me a lot, and is something I find the most fun, so it wasn't overly challenging.
- [ ] I added the ability for the picture in the full story view to scroll with the text, along with adding titles to make it feel more professional. Additionally, I removed the annoying grey outline you got when clicking out of a story.
